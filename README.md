# Driving Game on DE1-SoC
A C-based driving game developed for the DE1-SoC board where the player dodges incoming traffic:
- The player should press **S** to start and use **left/right** keys to switch lanes.
- Score increases with each dodged car.
- Speed increases by 1% after each dodge.
- Game ends on collision and dispays "Game Over" and final score.
